# QuARCS: Quantum Anomaly Recognition and Caption Scoring Framework for Surveillance Videos
Aniruddha Mukherjee, Vikas Hassija, Vinay Chamola, Senior Member, IEEE


Live video stream monitoring demands manual
analysis, often leading to inaccuracies. Thus, an automated
system is needed to monitor and report on video streams in
real-time or retrospectively within surveillance networks,
alleviating human error and inefficiency. Our study,
presents a comprehensive framework that integrates a
hybrid Quantum-Classical Anomaly Detection System, a
caption-generating model, and a novel Text-Driven Urgency
Rating Model (T-DURM) trained using a newly created labelled
dataset called UCFC-CUR which predicts an anomaly urgency
rank index (AUI). This framework aims to establish that
quantum technologies can compete with the current State
of the Art and outperform it’s classical counterpart. The
aforementioned pipeline possesses the capability to identify
anomalous occurrences from surveillance videos, generate a
textual representation of the event, and assign a numerical
value indicating the level of urgency associated with the specific
anomaly. The hybrid anomaly detection model achieved an AUC
of 82.80 surpassing Sultani et al.’s AUC of 75.14. While the
newly proposed T-DRUM model achieves a R2 score of 0.982.
